# Perfromnce Model for Configurable Cloud Applications

This projects consist of the Perfromance Models generated in Python for the purpose of the masters thesis of the author in Data Science & Entreprenurship.
The project consist of a Random Forest Regression, Decistion Tree Regression and Feedforward Multilayer Perceptron Regression models trained with parameter tuning GridSearch for each respective models.

Steps to run the project:
* set the paths to the data in file `Dataset_merge_RUN_FIRST.py`
* run the entire file
* then set the path to the 'Generated/final_data.csv' for the selected model
* run the selected model
